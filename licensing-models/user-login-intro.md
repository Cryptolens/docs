# User Account Authentication

> User account authentication is currently being updated. Please check back in the coming weeks.

User login authentication allows your customers to use a **user account** instead of typing in a **long license key**.
This makes licensing more **convenient for your customers** and makes it **easier** for you to **manage license rights** of each customer.

## Actions taken by your customer
Once your customer already has associated their account with the customer object (you can see them [here](https://serialkeymanager.com/Customer)), there are three
simple steps they have to go through:

1. Open the application and **click on the login button**
2. **Authorize** the current application in a browser
3. Done! Once they return to the app, **all the features** that they are entitled to **will unlock**.

## Actions taken by you (the vendor)
As a vendor, there are three steps that will make it possible for your customers to use this seamless feature:

1. Create a [new customer object](https://serialkeymanager.com/Customer) and tick the **Enable Customer Association** box. (*we will add support to our Web API soon*)
2. **Send the link** that is displayed to your customer.
3. Done! Now, they both have **access to a control panel** to manage their licenses and they can also **login into any of your apps** that support this functionality.

# Introduction to Web API

## What is Web API?
Web API can be thought of as a channel that can be used to talk to Cryptolens from external applications. It contains a wide range of methods that will respond different information depending on input parameters. For example, these methods allow you to activate keys, generate new ones, get list of activated machines, and so much more. It's always possible to talk to the Web API directly, however, you will most likely use an existing API that simplifies that task. If you use an environment that is not supported at the moment, it is always possible to use the Web API right away, which makes Cryptolens a platform independent system.

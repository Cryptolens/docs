# Introduction to Cryptolens step by step

Our aim of this tutorial is to guide you through, step by step, the process of
implementing Cryptolens into your application. We'll assume that you've developed a .NET application
and use <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2013</a>. 
If you are using a different language, we recommend to check out [this page](/web-api/skm-client-api).

> If you want to jump straight into the code, please check out the [key verification](/examples/key-verification) tutorial.

> Our application will have three features (voice, audio and converter), and  the ability to license these as a
'subscription' (time-limited) or 'perpetual' (unlimited time). We will check the license key when we have an Internet connection. If we're offline, we will
use the saved license file. The user will be able to use the software 90 days offline at most.

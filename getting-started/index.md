# Introduction

Our aim of this tutorial is to guide you through, step by step, the process of
implementing SKM into your application. We'll assume that you've developed a .NET application
and use <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2013</a>.

> Our application will have three features (voice, audio and converter), and  the ability to license these as a
'subscription' (time-limited) or 'perpetual' (unlimited time). We will check the license key when we have an Internet connection. If we're offline, we will
use the saved license file. The user will be able to use the software 90 days offline at most.

* [Create a new SKM account](/getting-started/create-account)

## Remarks

If your application uses C++, you can use our C++ client API instead (see the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cryptolens/cryptolens-cpp) for examples). Note, if you want to view code snippets for key verification in C# or VB.NET, you can jump directly to the [Examples](/examples/index) section.

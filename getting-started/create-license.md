# Create a Key

We're now ready to test the code using your account.

1. Select the product from the <a href="https://app.cryptolens.io/Product" target="blank">list</a>.
2. Click on 'Create a new Key'.
3. Check features 3,4,5.
4. Optionally, if you want to have a time limit, check feature 1 too.

In case you kept the code as it is (without replacing the token and pubkey with yours),
you can test the following:

* `IWXAZ-FVMOD-KBZQU-DKUFW` - all features in one years since this tutorial was written
* `IYVOO-JCWXQ-LCRBI-ZAIQZ` - all features but the recorder with no time constraint.

## Done!

You have successfully completed this tutorial! If you would have any questions, please get in touch us with us using chatbox available on each page.

Good luck! :) 

## Next steps
You've now implemented SKM into your application. Here's what's next:

1. [Get started with payment forms](/payment-form/intro)
2. [Learn more about possible licensing models](/licensing-models/licensetypes)
3. [Understand GDPR and its implications](/legal/GDPR)

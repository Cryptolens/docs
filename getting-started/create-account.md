# Create an Account

If you've already used Cryptolens.Licensing, you might recognize that you need things such as **access token** and **productId**.
Basically, you need some way of letting [Web API](/web-api/) know that you are you, and the product/license you want to use.

Before you get that far, you need to register an Cryptolens account and get a subscription.

1. In order to register, please go to [Register](https://app.cryptolens.io/Account/Register).
2. Once you have an account, please [Log In](https://app.cryptolens.io/Account/Login). `Note: The user name is not your email.`
3. Now, assuming you're logged in, please <a href="https://app.cryptolens.io/user/try" target="_blank">activate a trial subscription</a>.

If you've followed the steps above, you should be able to see a page similar to the one below:

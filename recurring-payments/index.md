# Recurring Payments

## Introduction
[Payment Forms](/payment-forms/index) are an easy way to get started with payments, particularly useful for selling products on a [perpetual](/licensing-models/perpetual) basis or with manual upgrades on a recurring basis.

The aim of the recurring payment feature is to make [subscriptions](/licensing-models/subscription) more seamless by combining Cryptolens license engine with Stripe. Your customers provide a card once and after that payments will occur on a regular basis, without them having to constantly remember to upgrade.

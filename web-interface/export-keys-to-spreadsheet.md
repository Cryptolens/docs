# Export Keys To Spreadsheet

It is possible to export keys to TSV, which can be opened by for instance Microsoft Excel and Open Office Calc. In order to export keys, go to https://app.cryptolens.io/Product and choose the project. Now, there are two options:

* Export current keys to TSV – exports only keys that are visible on the page (100 keys)
* Export all keys to TSV – exports all keys in the product

## In Excel
If you are using Microsoft Excel 2013, you can simply drag-and-drop the downloaded file into Excel. Otherwise, you should press on “Open Other Workbooks”.

If you get any window after that you have selected the file, simply press next until the wizard is complete.

As you can see, the Creation Date and Expiration Date are not visible. In order to fix that, make the column wider. Once this is done, we get something like this:

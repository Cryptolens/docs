# Export Keys To Spreadsheet

It is possible to export keys to TSV so that they can be opened in applications such as Microsoft Excel. On the product page, there are two options:

* Export current keys to TSV – exports only keys that are visible on the page (100 keys)
* Export all keys to TSV – exports all keys in the product

## In Excel
If you are using Microsoft Excel 2013, you can simply drag-and-drop the downloaded file into Excel. Otherwise, you should press on “Open Other Workbooks”.

If you get any window after that you have selected the file, simply press next until the wizard is complete.

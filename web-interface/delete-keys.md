# Deleting keys

At this point, it’s not possible to remove a key permanently for security reasons. However, there are two ways to achieve a similar effect:

* Selecting **OrderBy** to `Block (ascending)` (on the product page), which will list all your non-blocked keys first.

* Navigate to the [Security page](https://app.cryptolens.io/User/Security) and select **Hide Blocked Keys** (remember to **save** changes). In order to ‘remove the key’, you simply **Block** the key on the product page (i.e. by clicking on No in the Block column).

* Delete the entire product. It's a good idea to have **two products**, one used in **production** and one used in **testing**. You are only charged for products that are intended to be used in production.

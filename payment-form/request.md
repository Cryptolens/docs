<h3 id="request">Request Items (aka Webhooks)</h3>
Request items are used to call the Web API, for example. However, they may also be used to notify your website (as a <em>webhook</em>)
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Url</strong> - The URL that SKM Platform will call upon successful transaction.</li>
 	<li><strong>Type</strong> - The type of request.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>DataRequest</strong> - This assumes the website (eg. Web API result) returns a JSON object (a hashmap, to be precise). SKM will take these values and insert them into the thank you page, instead of the <strong>[name]</strong>. So, if JSON object is <strong>{"key":"ABCD"}</strong>, and our message contains <strong>Thank you. Your key is [key].</strong>, the customer will see <strong>Thank you. Your key is ABCD</strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong>VoidRequest</strong> - Simply sends a request without taking into account what it returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Method</strong>  - This can either be GET or POST. Web API 3 requires this to be GET.</li>
</ul>

### Custom Field
Custom field allows you to customize the requests that are called upon a successful transaction. For example, if you want to allow your customers to upgrade a specific key, you can call the payment form as shown below:
```
https://app.cryptolens.io/form/p/secret/12?custom=ABCDE-FGHIJ-KLMNO-PQRST
```
and add the custom variable to a request by appending [custom], eg.

```
http://app.cryptolens.io/api/key/AddFeature?token=&ProductId=123&Key=[custom]
```

If the transaction is successful, the desired key will be upgraded (in this case, a specific feature will be added). Note, you can also use [custom] can be appended to the message Custom Message.

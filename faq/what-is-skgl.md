# What is SKGL?

SKGL was an early version of a licensing system used to protect applications targeting the .NET Framework. It was developed in 2011. SKGL became popular due to its simplicity. However, it had several drawbacks, such as being **platform dependent**, using **insecure cryptography** and being **decentralized**.

## Cryptolens replaces SKGL
Using all the feedback that we received and taking an advantage of the cloud, we developed a clould based platform. In contrast to SKGL, it is:

* **platform independent** - at the time of writing, we support all .NET targeting languages and C++ (for both Windows and Linux).
* **secure cryptography** - we use modern cryptographic methods, such as RSA and AES, as well as abide by modern security practices.
* **centralized** - with your account, you have access to all license keys and customers in one place, anywhere and anytime.

In addition, we have added many more new features such as **payment integration** and **analytics**, and we keep adding new features based on your feedback all the time.

## How to obtain SKGL (legacy)
We **do not** recommend to use SKGL mainly due to the **security issues** it has. Instead, we strongly recommend to sign up for a Cryptolens account. If you still want to use it, the link is provided below:

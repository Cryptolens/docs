# Reseller Portal

> **Note:** The reseller portal feature requires a separate subscription. Please contact support@cryptolens.io
for more information.

## Idea

The goal of the reseller portal is to allow **software vendors** to delegate **license key creation** (aka license key issuance) to other users, which are referred to as **resellers**.


## Getting started

To get tailored documentation, please choose an option below:

### Vendor
If you are using Cryptolens to secure your software and would like to allow resellers to help you with
the distribution, please select the option below:

<a href="/reseller/vendor-intro" class="btn btn-primary">I'm a vendor</a> 

### Reseller
If you have signed up for a reseller account from a link sent by the software vendor, 
please select the option below:

<a href="/reseller/reseller-intro" class="btn btn-primary">I'm a reseller</a>

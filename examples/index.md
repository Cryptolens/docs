# Examples

In this section, we have listed several examples to help you get started. The focus is on applications targeting .NET, however Cryptolens does work with other languages too. You can find more examples in repositories associated with respective [client API](/web-api/skm-client-api).

If you want to explore other licensing models, we recommend to review [licensing models](/licensing-models/licensetypes) section, where all examples have code suggestions in .NET.

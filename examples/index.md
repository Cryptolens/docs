# Examples

In this section, we have listed several example to help you get started. The focus is on applications targeting .NET, however Cryptolens does work with other languages too. You can review examples for C++ [here](/web-api/cpp/cpp-client).

If you want to explore other licensing models, we recommend to review [licensing models](/licensing-models/licensetypes) section, where all examples have code suggestions in .NET.

## Inside your application

* [Key verification](/examples/key-verification) - prepared example for key verification.
* [Offline key verification](/examples/offline-verification) - prepared example for offline key verification.
* [Creating verified trials](/examples/verified-trials) - prepared example showing how to create verified trials.

## External services
* [Key generation](/examples/key-generation) - key generation (useful when integrating with third party payment services).

## Licensing models

 * [Perpetual licensing (try & buy)](/licensing-models/perpetual)

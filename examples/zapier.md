# Integrate with Zapier

## Introduction

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/Cryptolens/integrations) lets you connect Cryptolens to 2,000+ other web services. Automated connections called Zaps, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically

We have added a variety of actions and triggers that help you to automate a wide range of licensing tasks. From automatically creating new customer, to triggers that detect issuance of new licenses. 

## How do I connect Cryptolens to Zapier?

1. Log in to your [Zapier account](https://zapier.com/sign-up) or create a new account.
2. Navigate to "My Apps" from the top menu bar.
3. Now click on "Connect a new account..." and search for "Cryptolens"
4. Use your credentials to connect your Cryptolens account to Zapier.
5. Once that's done you can start creating an automation! Use a pre-made Zap or create your own with the Zap Editor. Creating a Zap requires no coding knowledge and you'll be walked step-by-step through the setup. 
6. Need inspiration? See everything that's possible with [Cryptolens and Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/Cryptolens/integrations).

If you have any additional questions, you can reach out to support@cryptolens.io or contact@zapier.com.

## Authentication
To authenticate, you will need an [access token](https://app.cryptolens.io/User/AccessToken#/). The scope of permissions depends on the action or trigger that you plan to use. 

For triggers, you would need an access token with `Get Web API Log` permission. For the actions, you would need the permission that corresponds to the method name. For example, **Add Customer** method requires `Add Customer` permission.

## Popular use cases

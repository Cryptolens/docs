# GDPR

By using Cryptolens, you can be sure that we will be compliant the 25th of May ([read more about GDPR](/faq/#gdpr)). Cryptolens is currently GDPR compliant, however, we are in continuous contact with lawyers to  facilitate several procedures. For example, for now, you need to attach a [consent to personal data processing](/legal/ConsentToPersonalDataProcessing) to your agreement, as described in the [Data Policy](/legal/DataPolicy), however, our aim is introduce changes that do not require this consent.

For now, please review the following articles:

* [Data Protection Policy](/legal/DataPolicy)
* [Making Agreement Binding](/legal/MakeAgreementBinding)
* [Consent to Personal Data Processing](/legal/ConsentToPersonalDataProcessing)

You can also review our data processor agreement:

* [Data Processor Agreement](/legal/DPA)

By using Cryptolens, you can be sure that we will be compliant the 25th of May ([read more about GDPR](/faq/#gdpr)). A simple rule of thumb, if you use Cryptolens for its intended purposes, you do not need to take any extra steps. However, if you start to use personal identifiable information for any other reason other than required for you to provide the service, an explicit consent is required from your customers.

For now, please review the following articles:

* [Data Processor Agreement](/legal/DPA)

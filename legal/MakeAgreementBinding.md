# Binding the agreement to your customers

## Why
When your customers are running your application, personal information such as the IP address is sent to Cryptolens AB. GDPR aims to protect users' privacy, which means that it is important that you have a consent from your customers in doing so.

To make sure that you are compliant, our lawyer has composed an excerpt that you can insert into your agreement.

* [Consent to personal data processing](ConsentToPersonalDataProcessing)

## How

If you are targeting a large number customers, it may not be feasible to get a signed copy of the agreement. Instead, there are several ways you can make it binding online. We have listed several suggestions below:

1. Before your customers can use your application, they should have opened a window that shows the Terms of the agreement (if you have your own end user license agreement) together with the Consent to personal data processing.
2. It must be ensured that your customers have read the documents before they can use your application. There are different ways to do this and a function with a non-pre-filled box can be used. The customer must actively tick the box to approve the Terms of the agreement and the Consent to personal data processing.
